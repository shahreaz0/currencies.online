            At Currencies.online, we prioritize the privacy of our visitors.
            This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information we

            1. Information Collection
          </h2>
          <p>
            Currencies.online does not require registration. We do not collect
            personally identifiable details unless you fill out the Contact Us
            form directly. Standard server logs (IP address, browser type,
            referral URLs, access timestamps) are collected automatically for
            analytical and debugging purposes.
          </p>

            2. Cookies and Web Beacons
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies to store information about visitor preferences and
            optimize user experience. Additionally, third-party advertising
            partners, such as Google AdSense, utilize cookies (like the DART
            cookie) to serve advertisements based on search interactions.

            3. Third-Party Ads
          </h2>
          <p>
            Third-party ad servers use technologies like cookies, JavaScript, or
            Web Beacons that are sent directly to users' browsers. They
            automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. These are
            used to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
